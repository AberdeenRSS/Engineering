# Engineering repository

This repository is there to keep track of all engineering related files. This includes:
1. CAD files (i.e. solidworks, etc.)
2. 3D printer settings
3. Documentation and notes

## Structure

The folder structure is the following:
1. `/docs` folder contains general documentation.
2. `/3d-printing` contains all 3d printing stuff
    1. `3d-printing/filaments` contains filament settings
    2. `3d-printing/printers` contains printer settings
3. Then there is one folder for each of the rockets we are designing (or have designed in the past). These folders contain:
    1. CAD files for the rocket
    2. Documentation
    3. `.stl` and `.gcode` files to print the part.

## Getting started
Have a look at the [How to use Git](./docs/how-to-use-git.md) guide. Guides on how to use the solidworks, 3d printing, etc. will be added soon.
